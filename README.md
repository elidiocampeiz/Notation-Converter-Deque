# Notation-Converter-Deque
Implementation of a Deque (Double-Ended Queue) data structure Class used to developing a arithmetic Notation Converter in C++.

The three notations are:

Postfix (Reverse Polish) Notation:
Operators are written after operands A B - C + == (A - B) + C 

Infix Notation:
The standard notation we use where the operator is between the operands. 

Prefix (Polish) Notation:
Operators are written before operands: * - A B C == (A - B) * C

The converter will be able to convert from one of those three to any other. 
The input will be a string written in a single notation, and the output will be the conversion to the specified notation.
The input string for the functions will only ever contain the standard four arithmetic operators (* / + -), an operand denoted by a letter (upper or lower case), a left or right parentheses (only round), or spaces. Whitespace (one or more characters of space) separate all operand and operators, while parentheses must have whitespace on the outside (between operators), and inside parentheses whitespace is optional. Parentheses are only used in infix strings. Parentheses must have operators between them, as all operations must be binary and not implied. 

For example:
ValidPostfix:c d/ab*rr */* Valid Prefix: * + AB- CD
Valid Infix: (( X+B) * ( Y- D))
Invalid Postfix:c d a b * r r * / * (Operators donâ€™t match up with operands) Invalid Prefix: * ^ A B & C D (Invalid Characters)
Invalid Infix: ((a / f) ((a * b) / (r * r))) (No operator between parentheses)

Abstract Class Methods
std::string postfixToInfix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of postfix notation and returns a string in the infix notation std::string postfixToPrefix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of postfix notation and returns a string in the prefix notation std::string infixToPostfix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of infix notation and returns a string in the postfix notation std::string infixToPrefix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of infix notation and returns a string in the prefix notation std::string prefixToInfix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of prefix notation and returns a string in the postfix notation std::string prefixToPostfix(std::string inStr)
This method takes in a string of prefix notation and returns a string in the postfix notation

These methods will all be instance methods of the class NotationConverter
